### Mock WebGPU for Jest

This package is under construction, I will expand it as I need it for other projects I am developing. If you want to contribute, you are welcome [:

```bash
npm install jest-webgpu-mock
```

update your jest configuration to include the setup file:

```js
module.exports = {
    ...
    setupFiles: ["jest-webgpu-mock"],
};
```
